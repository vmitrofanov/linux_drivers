# What is that
This is a stmmac driver support for using Zero-copy meachanism by af_xdp socket family.
It consists of a patch and two files. To get changes apply only a patch. This two files are used only for your interest . I did not see the meaning to upload all files with small changes. To be familiar you can just examine af_xdp.c and af_xdp.h. To get Zero-copy support apply patch)
